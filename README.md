Power BI DashBoard For Atliq's Hotel Chain Performance

## About Atliq's Hotel Chain
Atliq's Hotel Chain comprises of 25 Hotels located over 4 different cities in India. Bookings can be made for any of the Atliq's Hotels through platforms like direct online , direct offline, journey ,logtrip ,makeyourtrip , etc. The bookings are further divided based on room categeory  which are RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4 which represent Standard, Elite, Premium & Presedential Rooms respectively. These bookings can be cancelled by the customers, there can be a no show where customers did not arrive despite making a bookings or have been checked out. Additionally all bookings done provide ratings for their stay.

## About Project
In this project I have built a dasboard with data provided for bookings done by customers over a period of 13 Weeks (May-June-July2022). The dashboard provides information for analysis both on week level comparisions as well as monthly level analysis. Filters enabled for city & hotel level analysis where stake holders can see a performance of any hotel with their Key Metrics like Realistaion %, Occupancy %,  RevPar(Revenue Per Available Room), DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights), ADR (Average Daily Rate), etc.  Mainly emphasized on helping stake holders understand Occucpany & ADR Distribution on Weekday & Weekends.

## Key Insights From The Project
1. It can be seen that RevPar (Revenue Per Available Room) is very static in the sense that a fixed amount is been charged on weekdays and a fixed amount is charged on weekends irrespective of the time of the year even in May when schools are on summer break throughout India it is more likely that families would go out on trips but through this dashboard we can see there was no such spike in May we can conclude that we missed major opportunity to increase Revenue during this period.

2. Ratings and Revenue are strongly related Hotels with <3 Ratings in respective City's also have least Revenue in that city. Same is the case with Occupany & Ratings.

3. Revenue for Elite Rooms is the highest over the 3 months with 553.74M RS. as compared to Standard 305.64M Rs. We can tell the Elite Rooms have significantly High Number of Rooms booked which is why Atliq was so succesful here.
